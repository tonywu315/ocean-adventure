## Inspiration
For our first hackathon, we decided to create an educational website to teach users about the zones of the ocean and some of the aquatic life that inhabits those zones.

## What it does
Ocean Adventure provides the user a unique, interactive experience to explore and navigate the three zones of the ocean, as well as certain species of animals that live there. By scrolling down after clicking start, users can navigate through the deep-sea at their own pace and learn about the Surface Zone, Twilight Zone, and the Deep-Sea. Users are also placed in a first person point of view as when they move their pointer the ocean bubbles become clearer and expand.

## How we built it
We built the website using React and collaborated over Github.

## Challenges we ran into
Since this was our first hackathon for all four of us, we had to learn how to effectively use Github and Git to collaborate together on Ocean Adventure. We ran into challenges about how to make the website visually appealing, easy to use, and informative at the same time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the way we managed to add a lot of information without making the user interface too cluttered.

## What we learned
We came in with little knowledge about web development and Git, but over the course of the Hackathon, we learned a lot about React.

## What's next for Ocean Adventure
In the future, we can add more animations, sea creatures, and locations around the world to explore our diverse world!
